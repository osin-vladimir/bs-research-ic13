## Human memory recall system (Bachelor Research)

### Introduction 
This solution is based on the method of associations. Sometimes, people suffering from amnesia, can get a chance to remember some moments of their lives being in familiar surroundings. People get 90% of the information through their eyes. That’s why the represented solution is based on the work of the patient’s eyes.


### Application session

During the session, a patient is viewing a collection of images that is based on the principle “from general to specific”. 
There is a probability that during the session, the patient will see the familiar images and his memory will recover. Ideally, after viewing the collection, the patient will remember a few key points. This will provide invaluable material for psychologists that will significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of the patient.
